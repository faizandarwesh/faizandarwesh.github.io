* **Route Drawing Android App** [(Project Link)](https://github.com/faizandarwesh/CG-Project): In this application we provide a way for our user to find the route from location A to location B using Google Map API. Inorder to find the route user have to set pointer on his current location and then drag the pointer to drop off location so that app guided the track using Google Map Api.
* **Angular & NodeJs Shopping List App** [(Project Link)](https://github.com/faizandarwesh/NodeJs-Shopping-List-App): In this particular web-based application user can maintain a Shopping List and can add, edit and delete items from that list as per need. Behind the scenes it performs basic CRUD operations using MongoDB.

* **To-do-List App using NodeJs** [(Project Link)](https://github.com/faizandarwesh/To-do-List-App-using-Node-js): In this project I worked on basic CRUD operations using MongoDB to create a simple to-do-list app that holds the task that user want to do in future and keep track of them.


* **Vending Machine Project** [(Project Link)](https://github.com/faizandarwesh/To-do-List-App-using-Node-js): This is a C# form based application that is useful for purchasing items like chips, drinks and some other items.


* **Food Ordering Android App** [(Project Link)](https://github.com/faizandarwesh/To-do-List-App-using-Node-js): This application is based on Ordering food items from selected categories and add all the order to the ordered list and send all the order details to the user via email.


* **Friendly Chat Android App** [(Project Link)](https://github.com/faizandarwesh/To-do-List-App-using-Node-js): This project is based on the implementation of a group chat application using Firebase Database. By using this app user can create an account and then able to change and exchange media files with group members.

* **Pizza Zone App** [(Project Link)](https://github.com/faizandarwesh/Pizza-Project): This is a C# form based application that is used for the purposes of ordering pizza. It includes some other items like drinks and salads and also maintain billing information of the order.

Achievements:

* Deployment of company's first Apache Spark cluster
* Deployment of company's first Apache Hadoop cluster
* Architecting company's first Machine Learning pipeline

Problems I have worked with:

* Customer churn
Identifying the reasons of churn
Support marketing teams in designing targeted campaigns based on data driven insights
Predict customers that are more likely to churn
A consistent and company-wide accepted measure of churn.

* Infrastructure health, and capacity planning
In this project I worked on development and deployment of data ingestion and storage pipeline. Collection and robust, scalable storage of machine generated metrics of a global network. The data was then used for monitoring the health of global IT infrastructure. Aid in scheduled load and capacity planning. This also reduced the manual effort of gathering data and compiling hefty reports, and increased accuracy and visibility.
